			Michael Dean Bretz passed on Saturday July 30, 2022, at age 64 after a long battle against
			cancer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Michael was born on May 4, 1958, to Nicholas and Barbara (Catron) Bretz at Mercy Hospital in
			Denver, Colorado. He was the oldest of four children. Mike graduated from Arvada High School,
			where he played trumpet in the Arvada High School concert, jazz, and marching bands and
			enjoyed trips the band took to other cities and states. His first job was with the Rocky
			Mountain News where he and his friends loaded many pounds of newspapers on their bikes before
			riding up and down the hills of northern Arvada delivering papers every day of the week. He
			later worked at McDonald’s to earn funds to purchase his beloved 1970 Pontiac GTO. After high
			school, Mike worked in construction before seeking employment at Rocky Flats at which time he
			began seeking his college education. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree from Regis
			University, and a Master of Science degree in Environmental Policy and Management from the
			University of Denver.  Then he managed environmental restoration and hazardous waste projects
			which took him to Boston, St. Louis, Kansas City, Leadville, and Eastern Washington, as well
			as here in Colorado. Throughout his life Mike was active in the Arvada community; he was an
			Arvada Volunteer Firefighter, a catcher in the Men&#39;s Senior Recreational Baseball
			Association, and spent many summers volunteering with the Arvada Farmers Market. Above all
			Mike was an immensely dedicated father to his two children Miranda (Randi) and Dylan. His
			children fondly remember Mike’s unique and identifiable whistle, which could always be heard
			from the sidelines of their various sporting events. Additionally, Mike with his children,
			built wood furnishings together as Mike was a skilled wood craftsman, and enjoyed countless
			bike rides and camping trips across Colorado. He will be greatly missed by his friends and
			family.
		</p>
		<p>
			He is survived by his daughter Miranda Merry (Tyler), son Dylan, his parents, sisters;
			Michelle Bretz, Denise Newell, and Sherri Schmallen (Paul) as well as many aunts, uncles,
			nieces, nephews, and cousins. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests donations be made in
			Mike’s name to <a
